1. What is the overall number of chocolate bars rated?

There are 1852 rows, so excluding the title row there are 1851 chocolate bars that were rated. 


2. How does the number of ratings depend on the year? Draw a bar chart of the number of reports.

```{r}
ggplot(choco, aes(x=Review.Date) + geom_boxplot() 
```


3.For each of the questions below provide at least one graphic as a basis for your answer.
